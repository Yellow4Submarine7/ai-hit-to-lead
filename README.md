# AI Hit-to-Lead Optimization Pipeline

AI-driven drug discovery pipeline from compound screening to lead optimization.

## Pipeline Structure

```
00-data-extraction/  - ZINC22 database download and SMILES extraction
01-screening/        - Virtual screening (Coming soon)
02-optimization/     - Hit-to-lead optimization (Coming soon)
```

## Quick Start

See individual step directories for detailed instructions:
- [00-data-extraction](./00-data-extraction/) - Extract SMILES from ZINC22 3D structures

## Requirements

- HPC cluster with PBS/Torque scheduler
- Python 3.10+
- UV package manager
- Open Babel
